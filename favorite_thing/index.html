    <h1>Ultimate Frisbee: My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
    <h2>By: Sara Dunnigan</h2>
    <p>My favorite thing about school is Eastside prep's girl's ultimate frisbee team. The team plays during the spring season. I have played for the team all 4 years of high school. I really enjoy this, the weather is always really nice because we play
        in spring. </p>
