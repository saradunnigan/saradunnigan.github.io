            <h2>Stinson</h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, the "far" off lands of West Marin are easily navigable. There are <b style="color:red">three</b> points of access to Stinson Beach. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
            <p>
                <b style="color:red">1st)</b> Panoramic Highway. Let's say you are coming from the great 101 highway. Either north or south you can easily take the Stinson Beach/Tam Junction exit, take a left at the stop light and viola you are on Shoreline
                Highway! Continue on Shoreline Highway for about 20 minutes and you will come to a fork in the road. Continue up and over the mountain. We are on your righthand side, across from Breakers Cafe and next to Sand Dollar.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <p>
                <b style="color:red">2nd)</b> Sir Francis Drake Blvrd. Do you love trees? Take a nice drive through National Park, Samuel P. Taylor, you'll want to go through Fairfax, which is the location of our 2nd shop... take sir francis drake all
                the way through to Olema, then take a left at the stop sign, following high way 1 towards Stinson. This time we'll be on your left hand side!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="three">
            <p>
                <b style="color:red">3rd)</b> Bolinas Road in Fairfax. This road is a straight shot from Fairfax to Mt. Tam or Bolinas. From 101 take exit to San Rafael, you'll find your way to Sir Francis Drake Blvrd. Instead of following that road towards
                Olema, you'll want to find your way to Bolinas Road which is off of Broadway Ave, kinda of a tricky road, if you can find it and safetly drive it... more power to you!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="fair">
            <h2>Fairfax</h2>
            <p>We are located at 69 Broadway Blvd. in Fairfax. There are a couple of ways to get to our shop... depending which way you are coming from. The easiest is taking Sir Francis Drake Blvd off of highway 101 towards Fairfax, you may either take
                a left turn towards the theatre, then a right, straight ahead you'll find a parking lot or you may easily find street parking depending on the day. The second option is to turn left at the stop light (Claus Dr.) then take another right.
                The shop is located between a laundry mat and an ice cream parlor... very convenient!
